\section{Discussion}
The experiments conducted in the previous section explored the characteristics of FDs.
When applied for database scheme normalization, FDs serve a well-defined purpose.
However, when it comes to obtaining insights about non-static data, FDs seem to provide little insights about what to expect from new rows that might be added in the future.

FDs do not seem fit for obtaining human-readable information about a (relational) database that is being used in a deployed application.
FDs show no resistance to noisy data due to the static nature of their definition.
In the field of data profiling, it was proposed that ``any dependency can be turned into a rule to check for errors in the data''.\cite[p.~9]{ABE19}
This does not seem to be the case in general, but only in a noise-free, static environment.
