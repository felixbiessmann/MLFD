\section{Introduction}
Data-driven methods change the way computer scientists approach algorithmic problems.
Rather than designing and implementing complex algorithms themselves, recent advances in machine learning have allowed for learned algorithms.
While these learned algorithm come with their own limitations and problems, e.g.\ lack of explainability, some of them have proven to solve classic algorithmic problems in a more performant fashion.

Kraska et al.\ showed in their 2018 publication ``The case for Learned Index Structures'' that different index structures can be replaced by learned ones, greatly improving performance.\footnote{\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01208}}

In the field of data cleaning and data enrichment, HoloClean lead the way for machine-learning approaches in the domain of data cleaning.
HoloClean is agnostic of the way the database to be cleaned is structured, making it versitile.

One important concept in relational database theory is the idea of \emph{functional dependencies}.
Functional dependencies stem from the early days of relational databases.
Historically, they were introduced to formalize schema normalization, where a normalized schema is one where no functional dependency between two non-key columns exists.
In the past, functional dependencies found broader interest in data analysis and data cleaning.
